# Low Ping and High Ping
* Below a ping of 20ms are considered exceptional and “low ping”
* Between 50ms and 100ms range from very good to average
* 150ms or more is less desirable and deemed “high ping”

**“Low ping”** is preferable – means faster speeds transferring data and receiving the server’s response.

**“High ping”** will most likely experience delays (or lags).


# Latency
It is the time (in milliseconds) that it takes for the ping to return. So latency is a measurement of the entire round trip of that signal while ping is just one way. Latency refers to the quality but not the speed of your network connection.

Network connection speed consists of 2 elements.
* Bandwidth or amount of data that can be transferred within a specific period of time
* Latency which is the time for that given amount of data to travel


# Lag
Lag actually refers to the delay or decreased speed that’s sometimes caused by high ping (or high latency).


## Reasons that your ping is so high
1. Internet service provider quality
   * Download speeds are how fast data is pulled from the server
   * Upload speeds are how quickly you send data to others
   * Quality of both your modem and router can impact the speed at which your network runs.
2. Internet connection speed
   * Higher connection speed lets you send and receive data faster
   * Slower connection speed can result in high ping which in turn makes lag more noticeable
3. Inadequate bandwidth
   * Insufficient bandwidth will affect the amount of time required for data to be sent out and then back, resulting in high ping (latency) and most likely, lagging.
   * The more devices that are connected and tapping into your internet connection the higher your latency
4. Firewall configuration
   * Disabling firewalls that directly monitor web traffic, in particular, will lower your ping
5. Geographical location
   * Distance between your system and the server can mean the difference between experiencing low latency or high latency
