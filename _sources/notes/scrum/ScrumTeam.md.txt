# Scrum Team

It consists of one **Scrum Master**, one **Product Owner** and **Developers**. Within a Scrum Team, there are no sub-teams or hierarcies. It is a cohesive unit of professionals focused on one objective at a time, the *Product Goal*.

Scrum Teams are cross-functional, meaning the members have all the skills necessary to create value each Sprint. They are also self-managing, meaning they internally decide who does what, when, and how. We have found that smaller teams communicate better and are more productive. If Scrum Teams become too large, they should consider reorganizing into multiple cohesive Scrum Teams, each focused on the same product. Therefore, they should share the same Product Goal, Product Backlog, and Product Owner.

They are responsible for all product-related activities from stakeholder collaboration, verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development, and anything else that might be required. They are structured and empowered by the organization to manage their own work. Working in Sprints at a sustainable pace improves the Scrum Team's focus and consistency.

Three specific accountabilities within the Scrum Team:

#### Developers
They are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable increment each Sprint. Developers are always accountable for:
   * Creating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog
   * Instilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done
   * Adapting their plan eachd ay toward the Sprint Goal
   * Holding each other accountable as professionals

#### Product Owner
They are accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team. Product Owner is also accountable for effective Product Backlog management which includes:
   * Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal
   * Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog Items
   * Ordering Product Backlog Items
   * Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood

For Product Owner to succeed, the entire organization must respect their decisions. These decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the Product Backlog, and through the inspectable increment at the Sprint Review.

The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the needs of many stakeholders in the Product Backlog. Those wanting to change the Product Backlog can do so by trying to convince the Product Owner.

#### Scrum Master
They are accountable for establishing Scrum. They do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory and practice, both within the Scrum Team and the organization. Also they are accountable for the Scrum Team's effectiveness. They do this by enabling the Scrum Team to improve its practices, within the Scrum framework.
