## What is Scrum?
It is a framework for developing and sustaining complex products. A light framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.

It requires a Scrum Master to foster an environment where:
* Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog
* Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an increment of value during a Sprint
* Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint
* Repeat

Scrum framework is purposefully incomplete, only defining the parts required to implement Scrum theory. It is built upon by the collective intelligence of the people using it. Rather than provide people with detailed instructions, the rules of Scrum guide their relationships and interactions. Scrum makes visible the relative efficacy of current management, environment, and work techniques, so that improvements can be made.

## Scrum Theory
Scrum is founded on empiricism and lean thinking. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what observed. Lean thinking reduces waste and focuses on the essentials.

It emplys an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and to control risk. Scrum engages groups of people who collectively have all the skills and expertise to do the work and share or acquire such skills as needed.

Scrum combnines four formal events for inspection and adaptation within a containing event, the Sprint.

#### Transparency
The emergent process and work must be visible to those performing the work as well as those receiving the work. Important decisions are based on the perceived state of its three formal artifacts. Artifacts that have low transparency can lead to decisions that diminish value and increase risk.

It enables inspection. Inspection without transparency is misleading and wasteful.

#### Inspection
Scrum artifacts and the progress toward agreed goals must be inspected frequently and diligently to detect potentially undesirable variances or problems. To help with inspection, Scrum provides cadence in the form of its five events.

It enables adaptation. Inspection without adaptation is considered pointless. Scrum events are designed to provoke change.

#### Adaptation
If any aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits or if the resulting product is unacceptable, the process being applied or the materials being produced must be adjusted. The adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize further deviation.

It becomes more difficult when the people involved are not empowered or self-managing. A Scrum Team is expected to adapt the moment it learns anything new through inspection.
