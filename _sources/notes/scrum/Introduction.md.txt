# Introduction
Agile refers to a set of “methods and practices based on the values and principles expressed in Agile Manifesto”, which includes things like collaboration, self-organization, and cross functionality of teams.

### What is Scrum?
* Framework for new product development
* Manifesto for Agile Software Development

   We are uncovering better ways of developing software by oding it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
   * **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
   * **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
   * **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
   * **Responding to change** over following plan

   That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

* **Sprint**

   Every sprint contains every some combination of analysis, design, actual implementation, testing, planning for the future, maybe will be actually shipping or deploying more frequently.

* Scrum is hard to practice. It takes couragement and commitment
