# The Three Pillars of Empiricism (Scrum)

## What is Empirical Process Control?

When we talk about any process control, we talk about three elements:
1. Input
2. Process (structured set of activities designed to accomplish a specific objective)
3. Output

In Scrum, decisions are made based on observation and experimentation rather than on detailed upfront planning. Empirical process control relies on the three main ideas of transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

Empiricism means working in a fact-based, experience-based, and evidence-based manner. Scrum implements an empirical process where progress is based on observations of reality, not fictitious plans. Scrum also places great emphasis on mind-set and cultural shift to achieve business and organizational Agility.

#### Transparency

This means presenting the facts as is. All people involved—the customer, the CEO, individual contributors—are transparent in their day-to-day dealings with others. It allows all facets of any Scrum process to be observed by anyone. This promotes an easy and transparent flow of information throughout the organization and creates an open work culture.

#### Inspection

The inspection can be done for the product, processes, people aspects, practices, and continuous improvements. If the customer changes the requirements during inspection, the team does not complain but rather adapts by using this as an opportunity to collaborate with the customer to clarify the requirements and test out the new hypothesis.

Inspection in Scrum is depicted through the following:
* Use of a common Scrumboard and other information radiators which show the progress of the Scrum Team on completing the tasks in the current Sprint
* Collection of feedback from the customer and other stakeholders during the Develop Epic(s), Create Prioritized Product Backlog , and Conduct Release Planning processes
* Inspection and approval of the Deliverables by the Product Owner and the customer in the Demonstrate and Validate Sprint process.

#### Adaptation

In this context it is about continuous improvement, the ability to adapt based on the results of the inspection. It happens as the Scrum Core Team and Stakeholders learn through transparency and inspection and then adapt by making improvements in the work they are doing.
