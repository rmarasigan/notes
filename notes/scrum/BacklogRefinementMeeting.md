# Backlog Refinement Meeting

### Product Backlog Item
* **I**ndependent
   * As the team learns modern engineering practices that reduce dependencies, the Product Owner gains the ability to prioritize by business value rather than technical efficiencies
* **N**egotiable
   * Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. See [Agile Manifesto Principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html).
* **V**aluable
   * A well-formed PBI is customer-centric, so the business value is clear
* **E**stimable
   * If we can't agree on a rough estimate for a PBI, it's a clue we don't understand it yet
* **S**mall
   * A single PBI should be no bigger than a quarter of the team effort for one Sprint. Ideally, the PBI should be even smaller than that, such as one or two team days.
* **T**estable
   * Each item should have a cler, bright finish line agreed between the Team and PO.
* It is often useful to identify *who*, *what* and *why* in a Product Backlog Item
* The Product Owner is the one who is ultimately responsible for prioritizing the Product Backlog Items
* **Definition of done** applies globally to all PBIs for a product, while **acceptance criteria** pertain to specific items. **Acceptance criteria** could also form the basis of new stories
* Product Backlog Grooming / Backlog Estimation / Story Time

#### Purpose
* Estimation of effort
* Clarification of requirements
* Decomposition of large PBIs into smaller ones (e.g. epics to user stories)
