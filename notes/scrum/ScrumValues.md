The Scrum Team commits to achieving its goals and to supporting each other. Their primary focus is on the work of the Sprint to make the best possible progress toward these goals. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders are open about the work and the challenges. Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people, and are respected as such by the people with whom they work. The Scrum Team members have the courage to do the right thing, to work on tough problems.

The Scrum Team members learn and explore the values as they work with the Scrum events and artifacts. When these values are embodied by the Scrum Team and the people they work with, the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life building trust.

## Commitment
Scrum teams must be committed to progress and willing to have practical objectives and stick to them. This is a team activity where you are part of a team, and you are accountable to work together and to conform to your commitments

Can be expressed in three ways
* **Sprint-based commitment**
   * Sprint reflects the realistic goals and a short time duration to achieve these goals. Thus, the team has to be committed to their tasks in order to achieve the Sprint goals.
* **Commitment as a team**
   * As a team, you need to welcome the changes and represent the adaptability. As a team, you can achieve the project goals in smaller chunks. In case of any issue raised, the team can gather and discuss with each other to come up with a concrete solution to tackle the issue.
* **Commitment as an individual**
   * Being an individual in a team, you should contribute as much as you can to achieve the Sprint goal. This represents your commitment as an individual. As an individual, you can exhibit a commitment to learning, collaboration, following Scrum values, working software, and so on.

## Focus
An iterative-incremental approach and timely delivery in Scrum helps to keep us stay focussed towards the project goal. By focussing more on a goal, you can avoid resource wastage and deliver on time. This Scrum value leverages lower rate of risks and provides ample time to improve and deliver the needful.

## Openness
Team members should be open about their work, progress, what they learned and the issues they are facing. Also, you should be open to working with colleagues, recognizing individuals to be individuals, and not assets, robots or replaceable pieces of hardware.

You  should always be open to team up with the stakeholders in terms of orders and abilities. You should be open to work together with team members in any extensive condition. As a team member, you should be open towards sharing a feedback and gaining from each other.

## Respect
As a part of the Scrum team, you should respect colleagues, their decisions, and their experience. As an efficient team member, you should also respect diversity. You should respect your stakeholders by not building anything in which people are not interested. As a part of the Scrum team, you should respect each otherâ€™s skills, knowledge, and insights.

## Courage
Adaptability to change forms the bedrock of any Scrum project and to accept a change, courage is needed.
