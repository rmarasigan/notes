# Sprint Review Meeting

Open to any stakeholders. The highlight of every Sprint Review Meeting is a live product demonstration. The team will demonstrate their attempt to build a potentially shippable product increment to the Product Owner. After that the Product Owner will declare which of the PBIs committed to the Sprint meet the acceptance criteria agreed at the Sprint Planning Meeting and whether Sprint goals were met.

When the Product Owner considers items done they’ll be counted as velocity. The only purpose of velocity is to help the Product Owner make forecasts. Items that are not done – or “almost done” – will be moved in their entirety back to the Product Backlog.

**Agenda**
* Product Demonstration
* Product Owner declares what's done
* (Optional) Measure velocity
   * This isn't part of Scrum, but it can sometimes be useful
* Stakeholder feedback

The Sprint Review Meeting is a key inspect and adapt mechanisms in Scrum so we want to avoid things that could interfere with transparency. First thing we should see at the Sprint Review Meeting is live demonstration of potentially shippable (properly tested) product increment. The best time within the Sprint Review Meeting to discuss feedback from outside stakeholders is at the end, after the demonstration and measurement of which goals were achieved.

If the Product Owner feels the PBI is done, but there are other related things he wants, declare this PBI done. The additional functionality should be identified by other PBIs. Until an item is properly tested, calling it any amount of done is pure fantasy. If we don’t know what’s wrong with it, we don’t know what’s involved with fixing it. Or fixing the other problems caused by fixing it. But calling the whole PBI not done will reduce our velocity. *Definition of done* is much more important than velocity metrics.
