# Daily Scrum Meeting

Timebox: 15 minutes

At this meeting, each of you will report to the rest of the team your answers to the three questions:
* What did I do yesterday (or since the last Scrum Meeting)?
* What will I do today (or before the next Scrum Meeting)?
* What impedes me (blocks my progress, reduces my effectiveness etc.)?

As a self-organization team, you're collectively responsible for collaborating with each other, and this meeting can help you remind to do that.

### Test Driven Development (TDD)
Involves creating tests and code nearly simultaneously, while constantly improving the design. Many Agile developers believe TDD helps ensure correct implementation while reducing the cost of change. TDD is not part of Scrum. Scrum is only a management framework. It does not specify particularly technical practices.

### Pair programming
Two people who share one workstation, typically taking turns typing while the other pays attention and helps.


#### Question
Eddie is always late. Other than Eddie, who is responsible for the integrity of Eddie's agreements with his team?

The Team, and the Scrum Master must help create the circumstances for the team to take this responsibility. This may include techniques such as nudging people and modeling behavior.
